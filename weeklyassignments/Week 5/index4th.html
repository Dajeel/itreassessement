      <i>What is Web Design?<br /></i>
    </h1>
    <p style="color: white">
      Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the
      internet. It usually<br />
      refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than
      software<br />
      development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for
      desktop<br />
      browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet
      browsers has<br />
      become ever-increasingly important.
